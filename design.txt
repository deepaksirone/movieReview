Design
______

The basic design has 3 modules :

i) Corrpution Remover
ii) Ranking System
iii) Html Output module

i)Corruption Remover

Read one line at a time from the input file.
Jump from one space character to the next till there is a colon in the word immediately after a space.
If there is a colon in the word immediately after the space,replace the space with a marking character.

Eg:
Input 
Movie: Conjuring sudev: Waste of time abhijith:good movie
Output
Movie: Conjuring<newline marker>sudev:Waste of time<newline marker>abhijith:good movie

After this procedure is done, the file (maybe a new edited file can be created) ,is re-read and re-written with the movie name and the comments on different lines,separately, using the markings done earlier.


ii) Ranking System 

The ranking system has a list of words, using which each induvidual line of the corruption-free file is ranked.
Different words are given different scores , and the sum total of the scores for a line , is its respective score.
The total sum of scores is noted.
The top 3 and the bottom 3 scoring line numbers are noted.

iii)Html Output Module

The module has a template ,consisting of html tags.Using the output from the ranking system the appropriate entries in the template are filled and the output redirected/written to a file, which is then saved in .html format.
